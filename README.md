MEAN based e-commerce website project

**Scope** :
Developed a MEAN based E-Commerce website using Walmart APIs. I also integrated with Google and
Facebook APIs for login and authentication.

Implemented multi-page website from scratch (using RESTful routing/Web APIs, MVC, user authentication
(login/registration), front and backend validations, backend DB with basic CRUD)
Focus was to integrate multiple APIs into project and move the item through front end to back end.
